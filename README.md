# Java-Assignment-001

## Assignment 1 Playing with printing.

### Part 1 - AlanTuring.java
The line "// Write your program here" is a single line comment, and the Java compiler will ignore it.
* Add your code below the comment that prints the string "Alan Turing" and run the program.

The output of the program should be:
```
Alan Turing
```

### Part 2 - InAGalaxyFarFarAway.java
* Modify the program so that it will print the following text:
```
A long time ago
in a galaxy far,
far away....
```
* Use three System.out.println-commands for printing.
    * type *sout* and use Tab Complete in IntelliJ to save your fingers typing!
    * Remember *;* is a line separator so technically your *sout* statements can be on 1 line!

### Part 3 - JurassicPark.java
* Edit JurrassicPark.java so that it will print the following text (multiple lines) using only 1 print statement:
```
"Life, uh,
finds a way."
â€”Ian Malcolm
``` 
* "sout" -shorthand will still save you typing.
* Escape sequences and multi-line strings ("""String""") are OK

### Part 4 - Javadoc
* Go back and add the following multi-line *Javadoc* comment above each of your class definitions in all 3 .java files.
* Keep multiple authors.
```
